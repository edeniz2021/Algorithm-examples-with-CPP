# Homework and Absolute C++ Solutions

This repository contains solutions to homework assignments and chapter questions from the book "Absolute C++" by Walter Savitch, 6th edition, Pearson 2016. The content of this repository revolves around C++ programming and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It consists of two main folders: "Homework" and "AbsoluteC++".

## Homework

The "Homework" folder contains solutions to assignments given in a C++ course at school. Each assignment is placed in a separate subfolder and the file names are organized to be descriptive.

The content and solutions of the assignments are based on the course materials. Each assignment has its own README file that explains the purpose of the assignment, the methods used, and how to run the solution.

## AbsoluteC++

The "AbsoluteC++" folder includes solutions to selected chapters from the book "Absolute C++" by Walter Savitch. These solutions cover the example questions and exercises provided in the book. Each chapter is placed in a separate subfolder and includes solution files along with a README file.

The README file for each chapter explains the scope of the chapter, how to run the solutions, and highlights the C++ features used.

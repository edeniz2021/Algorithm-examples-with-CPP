/*Define a class named MyInteger that stores an integer and has function to get and set the integer’s value.
Then, overload the [] operator so that the index returns the digit in position i, where i = 0 is the least-significant digit.
If no such digit exists then −1 should be returned.
For example, if x is of type MyInteger and is set to 418, then x[0] should return 8, x[1] should return 1, x[2] should return 4, and x[3] should return −1.*/
